# EGMS
The European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) represents the bleeding edge of space-based remote sensing technology, using Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) data derived from Sentinel-1 to detect and measure ground movements across Europe with milimetre precision. We can download the data from the website, eg, EGMS_L3_***.zip 



Here, "data2xyzq.py" changes the data to lon, lat, mean_velocity, and distance. And "plot_xyzq.py" is data visualization.
